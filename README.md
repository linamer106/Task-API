# 📝 Task List API & Frontend

A simple full-stack project demonstrating how to build a Java REST API for managing a task list, and connect it to a React frontend for an interactive user interface. The frontend allows users to create, update, and delete tasks via API calls.

## 🚀 Overview

This project showcases the basics of API development and frontend integration using modern web technologies:

Backend: Java + Spring Boot REST API

Frontend: React (or Angular alternative)

Styling: CSS

Together, they form a small but complete example of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application.

## ⚙️ Features

✅ Create new tasks
✅ View all tasks
✅ Update existing tasks
✅ Delete tasks
✅ Fully connected frontend and backend
✅ Styled using plain CSS for a clean look
